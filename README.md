👋 Hi, I’m Bruno Ferreira

👀 I’m interested in spatial location of pipe burst events in water distribution networks

🌱 I’m currently learning optimization, machine learning techniques, hydraulic simulation

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on implementation of model-based and data-driven techniques in water distribution networks
